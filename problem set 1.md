Neural Network Models for MNIST Classification - Report
Introduction
In this report, we present the implementation and evaluation of two neural network models for classifying the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a classic dataset in the machine learning community, comprising 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The models are implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

Data Preprocessing
The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed as follows:

Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded using PyTorch's torchvision library. Training, validation, and test sets are created from the original dataset.
Normalization: The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1].
Flattening: The 28x28 images are flattened into 1D tensors of size 784 for model input.
